# to run correlated sampling
# you need set up 2 close enough systems
# check out examples in directory h2
# first run "python init_mf.py"
# this generates the files needed for correlated afqmc
# then run "mpirun -n {nproc} python test_eql.py"
# this takes the file from init_mf.py as input
# and runs correlated sampling to a given number of 
# propagation, and a given number of independen runs
